# Organization of code into multiple Files

## Links from docs covered here

I'm linking parts of the documentation which this particular code was created to understand.

- <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html>

## Description

I did not expect to find this section harder than the previous ones.
I struggled at understanding the documentation until someone shared this helpful [blog post](http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-module-system/) with me and I was able to understand it better.

Refer to `lib.rs` and the comments for an implementation of different modules etc.

Nothing more to add here.
